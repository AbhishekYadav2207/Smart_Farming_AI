**ðŸ“Š About The Project**

Smart Farming using AI is a web-based application that leverages artificial intelligence and data science to revolutionize traditional farming practices. The system provides personalized crop recommendations based on numerous factors including soil composition, weather patterns, and current crop distribution, aiming to optimize agricultural output while promoting sustainable farming practices.


**ðŸŒ± Problem Statement**

Modern agriculture faces significant challenges:

-Farmers often choose crops based on previous market prices rather than suitability for their land.

-Lack of scientific approach leads to overproduction of certain crops and scarcity of others.

-Overproduction results in price crashes and significant waste of resources.

-Absence of crop rotation leads to soil degradation and reduced fertility.

-Limited access to advanced agricultural technology for small and medium-scale farmers.

Our solution addresses these issues by connecting farmers with government agricultural departments and providing AI-driven recommendations that balance production across regions.


**ðŸš€ Key Features**

-AI-Powered Crop Recommendations: Suggests optimal crops based on soil analysis, weather forecasts, and regional production data.

-Crop Disease Detection: Identifies plant diseases from images with AI assistance.

-Soil and Fertilizer Analysis: Provides detailed reports on soil composition and recommends appropriate fertilizers.

-Crop Monitoring: Tracks crop health and development throughout the growing season.

-Distribution Control: Prevents overproduction by limiting recommendations when a crop exceeds 40% adoption in a region.

-Government Integration: Facilitates collaboration between farmers and agricultural departments.

-User Management: Different access levels for farmers, government officials, and administrators.
